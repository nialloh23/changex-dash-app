# changex-dashboard-app
This is a BI/Analytics app for ChangeX. It pulls together data from our product,
marketing, sales and accounting services to give a unified view on our organisation.

The dashboard contains a number of important sub dashboards including:
1. Fund Admin dashboard
2. Starter Demographics
3. Impact/Outcomes dashboard
4. Sales Ops Dasdhboard
5. ChangeX Organisation Performance
6. Machine Learning Model Performance



The app is built using the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).
Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code. To learn more check out their [documentation](https://plot.ly/dash).

This app utilises data from the following sources:
1. ChangeX App
2. Facebook Ads API
3. Segment.io API
4. Salesforce API  [Simple-Salesforce](https://pypi.org/project/simple-salesforce/).
